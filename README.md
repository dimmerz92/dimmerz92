### Hi there

I'm Andrew!

I am a corporate health data analyst with extensive experience in Python, R, and SQL in addition to Excel, VBA, and Power BI tools for interactive visualisations.

As of writing this (Dec 2023), I am in my penultimate year in a Master's of Computer Science, and am actively searching for supervisors to complete my final year thesis (all of my coursework has been completed).

Aside from my data analytics experience, I also have some web development experience after being accepted into the Coder's for Causes (CFC) 2023 Summer project where I was integral to the development of the navigation bar and GPT chatbot backend API for the Starick website.

In addition to my current studies, I have a bachelor's degree in medical science, and a post graduate certificate in predictive analytics. I have strong interest in high performance computing and very much enjoyed my units in parallelisation and distributed computing, of which, I would love to persue a career in, or at the very least, use and develop tools that integrate these concepts.
