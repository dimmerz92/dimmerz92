### Hi there

I'm Andrew!

I'm a lead data analyst for a large health provider in Australia. My bread and butter in this position is Excel, VBA, and **EXCESSIVE** use of SQL, primarily in Microsoft SQL Server.

While MSSQL is my primary language, I am comfortable in all flavours of SQL, with my favourites being SQLite and PostgreSQL.

I am currently in my final year of a Master's in Computer Science with the aim to finish at the end of 2024.
While I have acquired a little bit of impostor syndrome through this journey, I have thoroughly enjoyed my studies, especially in computer networks and parallel & distributed computing.

In my spare time, I am usually:
- Tinkering with my home lab, trying hardest to get around my current CGNAT predicament.
- Furthering my journey into web development using Go and HTMX as opposed to bloated unnecessary frameworks (React, Svelte, Angular... Pretty much anything involving Javascript!).
  - For context, I don't hate these frameworks, I enjoy working with them, I just don't think they are necessary for most small to medium sized applications that end up using them.
- Trying my best to further my knowledge in OpSec in an ever expanding and changing tech environment.
